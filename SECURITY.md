if it only affects this fork, please contact Kood/JÃµhvi (info@kood.tech) ASAP.

Include as much details as possible, such as:

- How to reproduce the vulnerability (step-by-step, screenshots or a video)
- The platform / environment it occurs on (e.g. OS version, DB type + version, etc.)
- Any potential fixes or reference code you think might be helpful in resolving the issue

The vulnerability will be investigated ASAP. If it affects upstream as well, We will forward this information to them and credit you.

A fix will be worked on in a private branch to resolves the issue. Once a fix is available, the advisory will be published.
