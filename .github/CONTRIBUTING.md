# Contribute
## Submitting code

Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should also contain tests.


You should also consider if the change can be used in [upstream](https://github.com/requarks/wiki) (It might even be better to submit there and later have us pull from it). However, DON'T send changes which only benefit this fork.
## Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.
It is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. Ask yourself questions like "What's the purpose of the pull request?".

## Requesting new features / Filing bug reports (except security issues, see [here](https://github.com/uristdwarf/wiki/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for that)
Create a issue on Github or (if you're in the kood/j√µhvi discord)
